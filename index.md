## About

Welcome to my page. I am software engineer by trade with a passion for the intersection of mechanical engineering and software engineering.

I have interest in a wide range of software domains including Software Development (mostly C# and Python but I'm hoping to find some time to learn Zig), Networking and Server Infrastructure (I'm building out my homelab) Machine Learning, Robotics and Automated Manufacturing.

I'm a jack of many trades and a master of none (except skiing). But like the rest of quote goes, that's often better than a master of one.

I currently work at DIRTT Environmental Services, I focus on integrating internal and 3rd party systems and automating manufacturing.
