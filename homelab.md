## Homelab

At the moment my home lab consists of a lonely Lenovo m720q mini computer.

I have proxmox installed on it and I am currently running a VM with pihole and an LXC with a tailscale instance.

### In Progress Goals

#### Host my personal website on a VM.

I am currently playing around with different ways to do this and learning as I go. I am in the process of
learning how to subdivide my network because my goal is to have this VM isolated from the rest of my network.

I've been working on properly containerizing the web page I'm writing in C# using Blazor but its becoming
clear that I didn't pick the easiest option, but we'll get it figured out.

### Next Steps

#### NAS

I want to build or attach a NAS to the Homelab, problem is I really like the small form factor of the m720q
so once again I'm making my life harder, the easy solution is to buy one off the shelf but at the same time
I'm trying to minimize cost. 

#### Plex or Jelly Fin

Pretty self explanitory here, this seems like the most tangible benefit after a NAS of going through all the
pains of learning server infrastructure and networking to get a homelab set up.
